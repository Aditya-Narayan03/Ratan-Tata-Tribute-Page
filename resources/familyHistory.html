        Sir Ratan Tata, the younger son of Jamsetji Tata, was a connoisseur of art and a notable philanthropist.
        His legacy of support to the poor and oppressed lives on in the activities of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust.

        Ratan Tata was the second son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the House of Tata. Born on January 20, 
        1871, he was 12 years younger then his brother, Sir Dorab Tata. Ratanji, as he was generally known, was 
        educated at St Xavier's College in Bombay.

        Sir Ratan joined the firm of Tata & Sons as a partner in 1896. After the death of his father in 1904, he
        looked after the affairs of the Lâ€™ Union Fire Insurance Co of Paris, of which Tata & Sons were the agents
        in India. He was also in charge of the trading firm Tata & Co, which had branches in Kobe, Shanghai, Paris,
        New York and Rangoon, and traded in cotton, yarn, silk, pearls and rice.

        Promoted to management during the 1970s, Ratan achieved initial success by turning Group company 
        National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.
        In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When 
        he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many companies heads, some of whom 
        had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due 
        to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then 
        made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of 
        their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent 
        was infused and given responsibilities. Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group 
        companies were streamlined into a synergised whole, with the salt-to-software group exiting 
        unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.
